            <p>"Fallin'(ACOUSTIC)" --- originally titled "Fallin'",is a song by American boy band Why Don't We.
                It was released on September 29, 2020, as the lead single from their second studio album The Good Times and the Bad Ones.
                It was the first song that the band released after their eight-month hiatus that began in early 2020.
                The song debuted and peaked at number 37 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming the band's first and highest entry.
                The song samples "Black Skinhead" by Kanye West, from his 2013 album, Yeezus.
                Aside from the original song, various versions and remixes were later released.
                A live version, an acoustic version, and remixes by DJs Goldhouse, Vion Konger, James Hype, and Taska Black were released.
                South Korean boy group AB6IX released a remix of "Fallin' (Adrenaline)" on January 7, 2021.</p>
            <p>"What Am I" --- The Eighth Song of Why Don’t We’s 2019 project, in which they release a single a month, was first teased on August 18, 2019, when people subscribed to Why Don’t We’s text message updates received a video link of the chorus from “What Am I.”
                Following this, the release date was confirmed on the band’s Instagram, with each member also posting a snippet of the track. In the caption, the band mentions that “What Am I” is an important one in their career, commenting: “this is more than just 8/12”.
                The world premiere of the track was paired with a music video, released at 12 AM Eastern Standard Time. Two weeks later, a lyric video for the track was posted to YouTube.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>"TRUST FUND BABY" --- “Trust Fund Baby” is about Why Don’t We’s band members wanting to be in relationships with independent women.
                Although Ed Sheeran is the song’s primary writer, Corbyn Besson’s verse was likely inspired by his girlfriend Christina Marie—on the day “Trust Fund Baby” dropped, she tweeted about embodying all the desired characteristics he describes.
                Over a year after it’s release, the song became the opening track for their international 8 Letters tour.</p>
            <p>"COLD IN LA" --- In “Cold In LA,” Why Don’t We beg their love interest to stay with them, metaphorically comparing this person’s warmth to the temperature in the city which they live – Los Angeles, commonly abbreviated to LA.
                It is the second single released after their debut album 8 Letters following their previous January release “BIG PLANS”.
                 The love song was fittingly released on Valentine’s Day, 2019.
                The song was initially demoed by band members Daniel Seavey and Jonah Marais, neither of which were in a public relationship at the time.</p>
            <p>"BIG PLANS" --- On “Big Plans,” the members of Why Don’t We ask a girl to “take a chance” with them in a relationship.
                The song was released on the 17th of January, 2019, marking their first release after their debut album 8 Letters.
                The song was first teased by Why Don’t We when they posted a snippet of the song to their Instagram.
                Within 10 hours of this, the song was accidentally made available on Spotify for half an hour, predominately to Australian and New Zealand users. </p>
            <p>"UNBELIEVABLE" --- The fifth installation of Why Don’t We’s monthly release project in 2019, “Unbelievable” was announced only hours before its release, dropping at 12:00 AM EST.
                Lyrically, the track divulges the disbelief of a boy whose crush reciprocated his feelings, doubting the reality, even though she’s “waking up in his bed.”
                The track comes a mere four days after some more unbelievable news of the birth of band-member Jack Avery’s daughter, who had remained a secret until she was over two weeks old.</p>
            <p>"COME TO BRAZIL" --- is the sixth installment of Why Don’t We’s 2019 project, in which they release one song per month.
                Soon after the song’s release, the boys broke the song down in an interview with Billboard, in which Corbyn Besson said this about the song:
                The whole idea behind the song is that you’re so in lust, or maybe even in love with this girl at first sight, that you want to go all the way to Brazil with her because even though it’s extreme – it’s worth it.
                It’s the thrill of the chase. You don’t even care how far it takes you, you just want to follow this girl wherever she goes. </p>
            <p>"MAD AT YOU" --- was only teased a day prior to its release on 24 October 2019</p>
